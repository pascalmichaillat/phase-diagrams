# Phase Diagrams for the New Keynesian Model

This repository contains a number of phase diagrams for the textbook New Keynesian model (NK) and its variant with wealth in the utility function (WUNK). The phase diagrams describe a range of situations:

* Normal times  -  The natural rate of interest is positive, and monetary policy is active.
* Zero lower bound (ZLB) - The natural rate of interest is negative, and the monetary-policy rate is zero.
* ZLB episode of finite duration - The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time T, and it returns to normal after time T.
* ZLB episode with forward guidance - The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time T. The economy is then in forward guidance between time T and time T+ D: the natural rate of interest is positive but the monetary-policy rate is zero. Finally, the economy returns to normal after time T+D. 
* ZLB episode with government spending - The economy is at the ZLB between time 0 and time T. During the ZLB, government spending is positive. The economy returns to normal after time T.

### Software

All the phase diagrams are produced with Keynote (version 11.2) on a Mac (macOS Monterey 12.2.1). The folders `nk` and `wunk` contains Keynote files for all the phase diagrams. The folder `pdf` contains the same phase diagrams saved as PDF files.

### Background

The construction of the phase diagrams is described in the article ["Resolving New Keynesian Anomalies With Wealth in the Utility Function"](https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_00893), by [Pascal Michaillat](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org) and [Emmanuel Saez](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/). The article (`article.pdf`) and its online appendix (`onlineappendix.pdf`) are included in the repository for reference.
